# Computer Vision Workout

This project uses computer vision to track your reps for curls, push-ups, and squats. This can help ensure that you reach the appropriate depth for each rep, and count your reps so that you can focus on your workout.  

## Changing Workout

In order to change the workout, you must change hte `workout` variable:

On line 11 of [main.py](/main.py), you will see the following code:
```python
workout = "push-up"  # "curl", "squat"
```
Change this string to any of the following variables to change the workout:

- `"push-up"`
- `"curl"`
- `"squat"`
